# express.js-note-taker

## Description

This project was made so that people are able to take down notes, save them and delete them as they please. Throughout the creation of the project I learned the importance of routing and how to connect different static html files.

## Installation

To install the packages within this project you must run the command "npm i".

## Usage

When you first load into this application you click the "get started" button and from there you can type down whatever notes that you would like. When you have finised typing your note you can save it by clicking the floppy disk button and the note will be moved into the side bar. If you no longer would like that note to be saved you can click the bin button that will delete the note.
